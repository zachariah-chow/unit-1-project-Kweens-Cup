Queen’s Cup - the Feminist & LGBTQ friendly King’s Cup Game:
A spin-off the traditional King’s Cup drinking game
Game aims to have less focus on traditional ‘sorority’/‘lad’-esque culture (so no ‘dicks’ or ‘whores’ rules), with more customisable options which will hopefully result in a less toxic, more responsible (socially and liver-wise) binge-drinking game (if that is even possible).
Ultimately a multi-player game, and will still need actual communication between players. App merely facilitates game by keeping track of rules (which traditionally tends to be harder once the game progresses and alcohol enters the blood) and various states. Also allows for small mini-games to keep things interesting.

App summary/features:
Start by configuring options: 
Options modal: set no. of players, player names, drink limit (responsible drinking), , any custom rules.
‘Rules' button to display rules modal
‘State’ modal that displays players, and keeps track of certain states i.e no. of drinks at stake, no. of drinks each player has had (responsible drinking)  and any ‘running’ rules.
Game begins, page displays player name, player clicks to display card.
Card will be the focus of the page and styled in the usual way - Ace to King, 4 Suits. Rules will be displayed in the centre of card. Option for a random wild-card which will present player with a simple mini-game.
At any point, players who have had to drink will click a drink icon which will add an update a drink counter.
Game ends when card deck is finished or drink limit is reached.
